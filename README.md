# whereistheISS
This app shows where the ISS is at this moment. Its coordinates are updated every 10 seconds and it is possible to see it on a map.

This app uses React and Redux. 
It gets data from 'Where the ISS at?' API (https://api.wheretheiss.at/v1/satellites/25544).

It is possible to change the time interval to update data faster or slower:
